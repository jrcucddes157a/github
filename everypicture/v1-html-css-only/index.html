                <section class="summary">
                    <h4>Summary</h4>

                    <p>The "Destroyer of Worlds". This is the title granted to the man known as Kamen Rider Decade. Yet
                        despite resisting his fate to become this, he never once abandoned that name. He'll even at
                        times destroy a world if it means it strategically makes sense. Something of an eccentric,
                        enigmatic man, his past holds a dark secret, and his powers are unlimited. Despite this, he is
                        still a hero, a Kamen Rider through and through, and continues to fight for justice.</p>

                    <p>Originally the "Great Leader of Dai-Shocker", an evil organization, he once used his powers as
                        Decade to conquer other worlds. However, at some point, Tsukasa gained amnesia during an
                        accident while traveling between worlds. He ended up becoming stranded in a peaceful world where
                        he met his best friend, Natsumi Hikari, at a photography studio named after the woman. As a
                        result, he picked up photography as a hobby, but becomes disappointed at the strange,
                        otherworldly distortion in them, constantly feeling like an outsider.</p>

                    <p>One day, while lamenting over his inability to recall his past, an Aurora Curtain appears and
                        separates Natsumi and Tsukasa. He encounters Wataru Kurenai, Kamen Rider Kiva, addressing him as
                        "Decade". He tells him to protect the worlds before being reunited with Natsumi...and monsters
                        appear?! What's this white belt device in his hands?! Wanting to keep Natsumi safe, and deciding
                        to follow Wataru's words, he becomes Kamen Rider Decade and fights! However, Natsumi's world is
                        destroyed in the process. Discovering it's a result of nine Worlds converging into one, Tsukasa
                        tasks himself to travel to these nine Worlds and resolve the disturbances, assisting the Kamen
                        Riders there. Who knows...he might just find the secrets to his past doing this.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="personality">
                    <h4>Personality</h4>

                    <p>The best way to describe Tsukasa is how Masahiro describes playing him: a "dangerous weirdo" with
                        a lack of civility. Despite his odd attitude and self-righteous, often rude mannerisms, and even
                        carefree, half-hearted mask...deep down he is actually a caring person, and a true hero that
                        shines. Thus, despite the facade, he's entirely willing to help those in a bind by any means
                        necessary. After regaining his memories and full control of his powers, Tsukasa even becomes
                        willing to depend on other Riders for help and keeps in constant contact with them as friends.
                        This can be seen in 2014's <i>Kamen Rider Taisen: Heisei vs Showa Rider</i> where he contacts
                        the half-boiled detective half of Kamen Rider W, Shotaro Hidari, to gain assistance in finding
                        out Shu's origins.</p>

                    <p>A notable aspect of his personality during the events of the season, <i>Kamen Rider Decade
                            (2009)</i>, is his clumsiness despite his talents and view on life. It becomes especially
                        noticeable when he grows too cocky. Natsumi keeps him in line, much to his chagrin. Since then,
                        it seems he has gotten over this aspect, but in turn has only grown more eccentric. For example,
                        by Kamen Rider Zi-O, he seems to obsess over the difference in the color he wears being called
                        <i>magenta</i>, and not pink.
                    </p>

                    <p>Tsukasa's biggest hobby is photography and loves it. However, the constant distortion of reality
                        that shows in his photos usually makes him feel inferior, despite brushing it off as
                        "unimportant". As a result, he becomes surprisingly cheerful if someone compliments his
                        photography.</p>

                    <p>Post series end, when he fully reclaims his memories, he has also grown more strategic and less
                        brash.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="powers">
                    <h4>Powers</h4>

                    <p>Decade has many powers that align with the fact that he is an interdimensional traveler, not the
                        least of which being opening the very portals that allow him to do so. Named "Aurora Curtains",
                        these ripples in space time allow him to travel through the worlds. Initially, only his shut-in
                        sister was able to open these, which a young Tsukasa exploited to explore the different worlds.
                        However, soon this power became his own by the time he regained his memories and recognized his
                        otherworldliness. Not only can these Curtains take him to different dimensions, but can even
                        serve as a means of teleportation or time travel.</p>

                    <p>Despite this, he is not subject to being affected by timeline changes. This is in part due to his
                        status as an otherworldly human, thus making him unable to be affected by this. It also allows
                        Tsukasa to act as a "human time capsule" should a major change in the multiverse happen. If
                        anything, whenever he enters certain worlds, he seems to gain new passive powers alongside his
                        current ones, such as being able to understand the language of monsters like the Gurongi in
                        Kuuga's world.</p>

                    <p>When he appeared in <i>Kamen Rider Zi-O (2019)</i>, he gained some new powers. Including creating
                        a Decade Ridewatch for Zi-O to use as a powerful form at the cost of half of his Rider Cards.
                        This allowed him to continue to fight even when Another Decade showed up, though only at 50% of
                        his power. He would also be shown in the show to be able to nullify Zi-O's titular Ridewatches.
                    </p>

                    <p>When Tsukasa fully regained his memories after sacrificing himself to stop a world convergence
                        event, he kept and could now control the power of altering reality at will.</p>

                    <p>The most iconic part of Kamen Rider Decade and what makes him so powerful is his RideCards. Not
                        only do they enable him to transform into all existing protagonist Riders, but even utilize
                        their powers. This makes him busted in terms of power scaling, as he easily has access to Riders
                        such as Kabuto, whose Hyper Form is capable of going so fast he can time travel. He also has
                        access to their weapons too.</p>

                <section class="funfacts">
                    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Masahiro Inoue loved his role as Tsukasa/Decade so much that he kept the Decade RideCard
                            prop in his wallet. Sometimes he pulled it out as a small joke when asked for his
                            identification.</li>
                        <li>The reason he is called Decade is because his season marked the 10th Anniversary of Kamen
                            Rider's return to TV after a nearly 20 year long hiatus between Black RX in 1989, and the
                            return with Kamen Rider Kuuga in 2000.</li>
                        <li>Decade's main theme behind his suit design and the primary gimmick to the show is barcodes
                            and cards.</li>
                        <li>A hilarious detail added in Zi-O via a side-special is his insistance on the color he wears
                            both in normal clothes and as a Rider being <i>magenta</i> and not pink.</li>
                        <li>The voice of his belt sounds is Mark Okita, an Australian born Japanese voice actor. He is
                            most known for this role and for being the announcer of SNK's King of Fighters XV.</li>
                        <li>Decade's design was slightly updated for Zi-O with the introduction of the Neo-Decadriver.
                            This added the graphic symbols of all the Heisei Phase II Riders up to Zi-O and gave him the
                            ability to transform into them. As well, its color was changed from the white and silver
                            design into a black and pink one.</li>
                        <li>Decade's camera is a special modification of a Blackbird Fly 135 Twin-lens Reflex Camera
                            with a pink front faceplate. You can actually buy this model as the company actually
                            produced it during the show's run! It's usually found on sites like eBay going for 350 USD
                            in "Used" condition.</li>

                <section class="summary">
                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <p>"The Ruler of Everything that walks the Path of Heaven". Tendou's ego might seem huge, but believe it or not, it's for a good reason. He is quite literally fated to utilize the Kabuto Zecter to become Kamen Rider Kabuto, the main fighter against the body-snatching alien threat known as the Worm. </p>

                    <p>It all began on a day 20 years ago, when a meteor crashed into Shibuya, nearly rendering the city nearly asunder in a major catastrophe. Since then, ZECT was founded as a means of combating the alien menace that emerged from this meteor: the Worm. Not only that, but a young Tendou was in the midst of this explosion, and would suffer from a slight bout of amnesia due to this.</p>

                    <p>Yet somehow, despite not knowing that a girl he meets at a cafe would be his long-lost step-sister, he always knew he was fated to become Kamen Rider Kabuto. Part of it because of a time travel scenario which set everything in motion, detailed in the prequel movie, <i>God Speed Love (2007)</i>. Despite his egotistical nature, there's something lovable abut the way he coolly handles the Worm threat. Plus, it's arguably well-earned from the fact he trained for this role for nearly 7 years since the incident.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="personality">
                    <h4>Personality</h4>
                    <p>If there's one word that can describe Soji Tendou, it's "arrogant". Not only does he call himself the "Ruler of Everything that Walks the Path of Heaven", a clever pun from his name, but he acts as if he's superior to others. Despite this, he is incredibly dedicated on all fronts. Not just for cooking, which he deems himself a master chef, but also to his role as Kamen Rider Kabuto.</p>

                    <p>Ironically, as skilled as he is...he's completely unemployed. Nor is he currently attending college. So he is what some may call a "surprising NEET". Though, it's not like he wanders through life aimlessly, as he is wholly dedicated to his role as a heroic protector as Kamen Rider Kabuto. As well, he regards his duties as an older brother to both his current and long-lost sisters and does his best to take care of them. Arguably, his actions to his sister borders on "sister complex" levels.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to fighting the worms, he is just as merciless with the Worms as the other ZECT riders. Given how they act and how evil they truly are, it's justified. Though he has been shown to show mercy to the Worms if he deems it necessary.</p>

                    <p>As seemingly perfect as he is, one of his biggest flaws besides the fact that he is only human despite superhuman abilities...is his secretive nature. This causes seeds of distrust to be sown amongst his allies, even his closest friends and family members, such as Aragami, A.K.A. Kamen Rider Gatack. As well, he can tend to get quite emotional despite his cool outward appearance, making him struggle to see things objectively.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="powers">
                    <h4>Powers</h4>
                    <p>To say Tendou is "superhuman" is nothing short of exaggeration. Considering he's trained himself for seven years to become Kabuto, he's basically at the peak of the human condition. As well, this training makes him an incredibly skilled combatant, able to go toe to toe with even the best of ZECT's Riders and Troopers. Plus, he's incredibly versatile and keen, able to adapt to all situations due to this preparedness.</p>

                    <p>Not exactly a power, but he is legitimately a master chef and is multilingual, shown to be fluent in not just Japanese, but English, French, and Italian.</p>

                    <p>Though arguably a passive power, despite being the least subtle person imaginable, he manages to be the most successful spy in the show. Effortlessly, he pulls off high level moves of espionage with no sweat, making it highly ironic.</p>

                    <p>As Kamen Rider Kabuto, not only is he is strong, but in his Cast Off Rider form, pictured here, he is faster than light with the Clock Up Ability. This ability is used by all ZECT Riders as a mean to combat the Worm's ability when evolved to move at these speeds. Even more powerful is how in his Hyper Form, he's so fast he's able to travel through time effortlessly. This makes Kabuto one of the strongest Riders in the entire multiverse, barring those that can use his powers such as Decade or Zi-O.</p>

                    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>His red color scheme, name, and horn are based off a real life beetle, named the <i>Kabuto-mushi</i>, or the Japanese Rhinoceroes Beetle.</li>
                        <li>Not only that, but his electricity based finishing move and overall design is a reference to a classic Showa era Rider, Kamen Rider Stronger.</li>
                        <li>Kabuto would mark the first season where Japanese Rock artist Ricky debuts as the lead singer of the in-house band, RIDER CHIPS. He would go on to be a part of the band permanently moving on whenever they made insert themes for Kamen Rider. The only song he does not appear in is LORD OF THE SPEED.</li>
                        <li>Unfortunately, Hiro Mizushima never returned to reprise his role of Kabuto after the series concluding. He is one of many cases of this happening, usually boiling down to Japan's horrific talent agencies and their micromanagement.</li>
                        <li>Kabuto's Zecter was supposedly intended for Kagami, but the Zecter chose Tendou from the start. Excitedly, the Kabuto Zecter finally chooses Kagami for a single fight in Kamen Rider Zi-O, during his fight against Another Kabuto.</li>
                        <li><b>SPOILER WARNING:</b> The events of Kabuto are actually the result of an altered timeline, in which the original Tendou from the movie God Speed Love, goes back in time as Hyper Kabuto to destroy the meteor to be smaller, as the original was large enough to cause a worldwide event of water vaporization, drastically changing the world and its landscape.</li>

                    <h4>Fun Facts</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Ryoma Takeuchi would be famous not only for this role, but for later playing as Kazuma Kiryu
                            in the Amazon web-series adaptation of Yakuza/Like A Dragon.</li>
                        <li>Kamen Rider Drive's car name, Tridoron, is a reference to the car Black RX drove, Ridoron.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Tridoron was built on top of the frame of a 2002 Honda NSX.</li>
                        <li>Drive is the only Kamen Rider to date that does not ride a motorcycle, breaking the trend.
                            Instead he drives a car, the Tridoron. The other Riders do ride motorcycles, however, to
                            make up for this.</li>
                        <li>Kamen Rider Drive is MY favorite season of Kamen Rider! :D</li>
                        <li>Shinnosuke's favorite snack is Milk Pops, a type of Japanese candy that is a stickless,
                            milk-flavored lollipop. This was done in special collaboration with the candy company who
                            produces them and sponsored the show.</li>
