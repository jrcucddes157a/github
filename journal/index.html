            <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>

            <h3>Part One: Studio Partner Response</h3>

            <p>I, uh....didn't get their image on Tuesday. So no response for this part yet. It'll be added sometime
                tomorrow I guess. Oops. ¯\_(0-0)_/¯</p>

            <h3>Part Two: My Own Image</h3>

            <figure>
                <img width="750" src="images/zero1edit.jpg"
                    alt="a model kit figure of Kamen Rider Zero One edited against a surrealist background">
                <figcaption>Image by Jordan Crooks, November 2025</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>What makes this image interesting is the techniques of Photoshop I used. I not only got to experiment
                with the Generative AI features Adobe implemented, but also got to test out its new feature of automatic
                blending. As well, I used advanced masking to preserve the slight reflection of Kamen Rider Zero-One's
                legs in this photo to not only blend it in with the generated background, but also remove any artifacts
                from the original image.</p>

            <p>It relates to my collection and my project in two ways. First, it directly represents the subject matter
                of my photos, which is Kamen Rider figures I own that were specifically Bandai model kits. This will tie
                into the greater overall narrative and theme of the appreciation and love I hold for Kamen Rider as a
                whole. It also represents the length I will go to to edit some of these images to make them look cool as
                hell. Obviously, I'm not gonna use generative AI this time around and it'll all be hand made. But you
                get the idea. I'll make it look like it belongs in one of the shows and not like an action figure.</p>

            <p>I think my collection tells a story about me by showing both one of my interests and how passionate I am
                for them. As well as being passionate in general.</p>

            <p>Since this image as stated in the submitted document is just a placeholder, the biggest obvious way to
                update the image to make it more compelling is literally changing everything about it. Making it a
                different photo altogether with the posing and composition. As well as changing the background and
                drawing on special effects akin to the shows!</p>

            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>

            <p class="date">2/10/2026</p>

            <p>We often hear, are taught, and use critical thinking skills in our daily lives, but it tends to be the
                norm that we don't think of the possibilities of its use case in anything other than writing
                applications. For example, critical thinking is often used in literary analysis for English classes, or
                when making a point in an argumentative essay. Applying it visually, however, is an entirely different
                case and one that I think should often get more attention than in just art history classes or topics.
                Especially since requiring people to understand what is going on through merely their eyes and process
                properly what's happening is becoming more and more important. I think learning about these skills and
                gaining is super important.</p>

            <p>The New York Times offers this in their Photo of the Week every Monday, where they present a picture
                without context or captions and ask students around the country to participate and figure out what is
                going on or what the picture is telling them. In the article, they outline strategies for creating
                deeper visual engagement, and I think they are all quite effective.</p>

            <p>Though the most interesting thing left out is how all of these photos deliberately engage users to
                interact with it based on the absurdity of the imagery, or genuinely attract audiences. For example, the
                first image is already an eye-catcher because of the striking image of a young boy diving from one trahs
                pile to another. It's through this striking imagery that people want to engage further. But it's not
                just images that can create this, but websites too.</p>

            <p>In researching the application for the website design side and how the strategies apply, I look to the
                awesome website created by Ray Ban as a promotional campaign, Ray-Ban.EXE. To create visually
                interesting images, it takes on a Korean inspired cyberpunk visual that not only imitates the aesthetic
                down to striking colors, retrofuture visuals that emulate CRTs, but also affects the interactivity. For
                example, when moving the cursor, the image of a character moves in a 3D space in direct opposite
                reaction. As well, the cursor has been changed to something more sci-fi. There's even sound you can turn
                on and off that makes the interaction much more tactile and noticeable.</p>

            <p>To me, this is an insanely cool website and already successfully creates the first step. It has me
                wondering what exactly the story behind such an ad-campaign is, and shows in the upper right corner the
                viewable anime that perhaps explains everything.</p>

            <h2>Research on Overlay Design Patterns</h2>

            <p class="date">1/29/2026</p>

            <p>I found the article <i>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Miusing Lightboxes</i> both a helpful piece of
                information, but also an endlessly fascinating piece of a time capsule for multiple reasons.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the information presented, even if by current standards of web design a decade after it
                is published, I feel like some of the principles still apply to this day. For example, one of the listed
                "good reasons" to use an overlay stated by author Kathryn Whitenton is that it requests users for
                critical information required to proceed. The cited example she uses is Chase Bank's website asking for
                a ZIP code on the page involving home mortgage quotes, as location is a huge dependency for the rates.
                Many sites still use that currently.</p>

            <p>For example, go on Google right now on a "incognito tab" and search up something like "Chinese
                restaurants". An overlay appears on the screen where Google will ask you to share precise location data
                to get the most accurate and relevant search results to your location. There you have two clear cut
                options to exit the overlay. Either "Not now" as your cancellation option, or "Use precise location"
                with a crosshair for confirmation.</p>

            <p>The antiquity and amusement however comes from seeing all the photos of 2015 era websites both on mobile
                devices and a desktop/laptop Mac screenshot. You'll find all kinds of design features we don't use
                anymore on sites like shading, gradients, noticeable drop shadows, borders, etc. Even some of the
                buttons like in the mentioned Chase example have that exact "Frutiger Aero" 3D-esque aesthetic to their
                buttons that was reflected in operating systems at the time, Windows 7/8, and Mac OS X
                Mavericks/Yosemite. You could only just barely see aspects of the blooming modern flat style appearing
                on sites like Apple's website. That's what makes it such a fascinating time capsule to me.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

            <p class="date">01/18/2026</p>

            <p>Doing research for best practices on form design, I read the following article linked below. Reading it,
                I agreed with many things and thought the article provided useful information. Even if some of the
                information I felt, as a designer, was extremely obvious. For example, making sure that the length of
                certain form inputs matching the length of the content. It's expected and often intuitive that the box
                should be shorter when inputting information like ZIP codes. As well, for the sake of mobile sites and
                preventing incorrect inputs, we force the keyboard to only display numbers or the full alphanumeric
                keyboard. A lot of it is standard fare.</p>

            <p>I only found myself raising an eyebrow at a part in suggestion number 16 when talking about providing a
                "show password" option. The author quotes Jakob Nielsen, and he says:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Typically, masking passwords doesn’t even increase security, but it does cost you business due to login
                failures."
            </blockquote>

            <p>Good lord, <i>NO!</i> On what planet is it not secure to mask your password? You have no idea who's
                looking over your shoulder at your screen. Especially in a day and age when display technology,
                especially on portable devices, really values high brightness and clarity for ease of readability for
                smartphone users. It is a good option to include a "Show Password" option in case of typing mistakes,
                sure. I use it myself sometimes, but this implication is dangerous and I think regardless all passwords
                should always be masked. Besides, consider it typing practice!</p>

            <p><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Here is the link to original
                    article.</a></p>

            <p>When it comes to sites that have great examples of forms, I think immediately of any commerce site that
                uses Shopify as its checkout platform. One such place that also serves as a community with visually
                pleasing and well designed forms for filling out post content is Drop, formerly Massdrop. It has a very
                clean, modernist design language that is very clear with little to no room for user error, like as if
                they picked the best of the best designers for the job on this site. It's such a great user experience
                browsing for products and more!</p>

            <p>Currently they are owned by Corsair now, but thankfully that hasn't ruined their brand nor their designs.
