            <h2>Research on Overlay Design Patterns</h2>

            <p class="date">1/29/2026</p>

            <p>I found the article <i>Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Miusing Lightboxes</i> both a helpful piece of information, but also an endlessly fascinating piece of a time capsule for multiple reasons.</p>
            
            <p>When it comes to the information presented, even if by current standards of web design a decade after it is published, I feel like some of the principles still apply to this day. For example, one of the listed "good reasons" to use an overlay stated by author Kathryn Whitenton is that it requests users for critical information required to proceed. The cited example she uses is Chase Bank's website asking for a ZIP code on the page involving home mortgage quotes, as location is a huge dependency for the rates. Many sites still use that currently.</p>

            <p>For example, go on Google right now on a "incognito tab" and search up something like "Chinese restaurants". An overlay appears on the screen where Google will ask you to share precise location data to get the most accurate and relevant search results to your location. There you have two clear cut options to exit the overlay. Either "Not now" as your cancellation option, or "Use precise location" with a crosshair for confirmation.</p>

            <p>The antiquity and amusement however comes from seeing all the photos of 2015 era websites both on mobile devices and a desktop/laptop Mac screenshot. You'll find all kinds of design features we don't use anymore on sites like shading, gradients, noticeable drop shadows, borders, etc. Even some of the buttons like in the mentioned Chase example have that exact "Frutiger Aero" 3D-esque aesthetic to their buttons that was reflected in operating systems at the time, Windows 7/8, and Mac OS X Mavericks/Yosemite. You could only just barely see aspects of the blooming modern flat style appearing on sites like Apple's website. That's what makes it such a fascinating time capsule to me.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

            <p class="date">01/18/2026</p>

            <p>Doing research for best practices on form design, I read the following article linked below. Reading it, I agreed with many things and thought the article provided useful information. Even if some of the information I felt, as a designer, was extremely obvious. For example, making sure that the length of certain form inputs matching the length of the content. It's expected and often intuitive that the box should be shorter when inputting information like ZIP codes. As well, for the sake of mobile sites and preventing incorrect inputs, we force the keyboard to only display numbers or the full alphanumeric keyboard. A lot of it is standard fare.</p>

            <p>I only found myself raising an eyebrow at a part in suggestion number 16 when talking about providing a "show password" option. The author quotes Jakob Nielsen, and he says:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Typically, masking passwords doesn’t even increase security, but it does cost you business due to login failures."
            </blockquote>

            <p>Good lord, <i>NO!</i> On what planet is it not secure to mask your password? You have no idea who's looking over your shoulder at your screen. Especially in a day and age when display technology, especially on portable devices, really values high brightness and clarity for ease of readability for smartphone users. It is a good option to include a "Show Password" option in case of typing mistakes, sure. I use it myself sometimes, but this implication is dangerous and I think regardless all passwords should always be masked. Besides, consider it typing practice!</p>

            <p>When it comes to sites that have great examples of forms, I think immediately of any commerce site that uses Shopify as its checkout platform. One such place that also serves as a community with visually pleasing and well designed forms for filling out post content is Drop, formerly Massdrop. It has a very clean, modernist design language that is very clear with little to no room for user error, like as if they picked the best of the best designers for the job on this site. It's such a great user experience browsing for products and more!</p>

            <p>Currently they are owned by Corsair now, but thankfully that hasn't ruined their brand nor their designs.</p>
