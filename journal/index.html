            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>

            <p class="date">01/18/2026</p>

            <p>Doing research for best practices on form design, I read the following article linked below. Reading it, I agreed with many things and thought the article provided useful information. Even if some of the information I felt, as a designer, was extremely obvious. For example, making sure that the length of certain form inputs matching the length of the content. It's expected and often intuitive that the box should be shorter when inputting information like ZIP codes. As well, for the sake of mobile sites and preventing incorrect inputs, we force the keyboard to only display numbers or the full alphanumeric keyboard. A lot of it is standard fare.</p>

            <p>I only found myself raising an eyebrow at a part in suggestion number 16 when talking about providing a "show password" option. The author quotes Jakob Nielsen, and he says:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Typically, masking passwords doesn’t even increase security, but it does cost you business due to login failures."
            </blockquote>

            <p>Good lord, <i>NO!</i> On what planet is it not secure to mask your password? You have no idea who's looking over your shoulder at your screen. Especially in a day and age when display technology, especially on portable devices, really values high brightness and clarity for ease of readability for smartphone users. It is a good option to include a "Show Password" option in case of typing mistakes, sure. I use it myself sometimes, but this implication is dangerous and I think regardless all passwords should always be masked. Besides, consider it typing practice!</p>

            <p>When it comes to sites that have great examples of forms, I think immediately of any commerce site that uses Shopify as its checkout platform. One such place that also serves as a community with visually pleasing and well designed forms for filling out post content is Drop, formerly Massdrop. It has a very clean, modernist design language that is very clear with little to no room for user error, like as if they picked the best of the best designers for the job on this site. It's such a great user experience browsing for products and more!</p>

            <p>Currently they are owned by Corsair now, but thankfully that hasn't ruined their brand nor their designs.</p>
